# 2.4.1

I have two issues: 
	1. I can't use nano in python. I tried downloading nano-python which downloaded but when I call it, I get this error

>>> nano-python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'nano' is not defined
>>> nano
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'nano' is not defined
>>> import nano
>>> nano ls_orchid.fasta
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    nano ls_orchid.fasta
                 ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> nano
<module 'nano' from '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nano/__init__.pyc'>

	2. So eventually, I just open TextEdit and save it to my Desktop. Then I try to run this code but it doesn't seem to like my path. 

>>> from Bio import SeqIO
>>> for seq_record in SeqIO.parse("~/Desktop/ls_orchid.fasta", "fasta"):
...     print(seq_record.id)
...     print(repr(seq_record.seq))
...     print(len(seq_record))
... 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Bio/SeqIO/__init__.py", line 636, in parse
    with as_handle(handle, mode) as fp:
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/python@2/2.7.16/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/contextlib.py", line 17, in __enter__
    return self.gen.next()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Bio/File.py", line 113, in as_handle
    with open(handleish, mode, **kwargs) as fp:
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '~/Desktop/ls_orchid.fasta'


So I'm obviously missing something simple. Can't I work with Biopython from the terminal without invoking python at the beginning? I prefer that rather than
	using python's interpreter.
