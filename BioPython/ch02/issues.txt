# 2.4.1

I have two issues: 
	1. I can't use nano in python. I tried downloading nano-python which downloaded but when I call it, I get this error

>>> nano-python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'nano' is not defined
>>> nano
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'nano' is not defined
>>> import nano
>>> nano ls_orchid.fasta
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    nano ls_orchid.fasta
                 ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> nano
<module 'nano' from '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nano/__init__.pyc'>

	To get around this I open my TextEditor Application (GUI) and paste the info then reference the file using the path.


	Is there a way to use nano or something similar within python interpreter?
