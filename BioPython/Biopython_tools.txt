# Sequence Work
1. create a variable and input your sequence
2. variable.complement() will give the complement of the sequence stored in the variable
3. variable.reverse_complement() will give the reverse complement of the sequence stored in the variable


# SeqRecord class 
1. Holds a sequence (as a Seq object) with additional annotation: identifier, name, and description
2. Bio.SeqIO module for reading and writing sequence file formats works with SeqRecord objects (ch 5)
