        Calling a 'slice' of the sequence: my_seq[4:12]
                1. Remember that python starts counting at 0
                2. Python includes 4 but excludes 12 ---- why?

	
	Start, Stop, and Stride 
		stride = step size, default = 1
	We can get the first, second, and third codon positions of the DNA sequence
		

	Add sequences together using the sum function (optional start value argument (default = 0)
		sum(list_of_seqs, Seq("", generic_dna))
# 3.8
	Transcription
	Biopython works from the coding strand (backward from Biology) because we can easily just change out the T for U's

	Doing a true biological transcription - do it in two steps
		template_dna.reverse_complement().transcribe()

	mRNA --> coding DNA strand (U --> T)
		back_transcribe()

	Translate
		mrna.translate()

	Can specify which NCBI table to use in the case of mitochondrial or the shorter table featured in GenBank files

	Translate to the first stop codon via
		coding_dna.translate(to_stop=True)
			** the stop codon itself is not translated and stop symbol is not included at the end of your protein seq
