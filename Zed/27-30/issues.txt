I got the following incorrect (predicted the opposite of what it really is), can you explain them?

not(True and False) = False

not (10 == 1 or 1000 == 1000)

not ("testing" == "testing" and "Zed" == "Cool Guy") = False

3 == 3 and (not ("testing" == "testing" or "Python" == "Fun")) = True

Can you explain what he is asking for in Study Drills # 1?


# exercise 30
can we go over elif and how it works more specifically? I'm having a hard time tracing it.
