# exercise 28

I got the following incorrect (predicted the opposite of what it really is), can you explain them?

not(True and False) = False
# what is True and False by itself?  Now flip it.

not (10 == 1 or 1000 == 1000)
# Take it in parts.  First do ANS1 = 10 == 1.  Then do ANS2 = 1000 == 1000
# now do ANS1 or ANS2
# now flip it.

not ("testing" == "testing" and "Zed" == "Cool Guy") = False
# again take it in parts.  Remember that == and != get priority over and

3 == 3 and (not ("testing" == "testing" or "Python" == "Fun")) = True
# I think that you forgot the not.

Can you explain what he is asking for in Study Drills # 1?
# Look up comparison operators in python.

# exercise 30
can we go over elif and how it works more specifically? I'm having a hard time tracing it. 
# We can talk about it.  The simplest way to think about it is as a series of if statements that you procede from the begining until you get a true statement or run out of statements (the else section)

# that website has some good flow diagrams.
