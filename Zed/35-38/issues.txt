	still need to incorporate a list somehow.

# exercise 37

# exercise 38	
	Why are the items listed in more_stuff being appended to the list backwards. For example the last things on the list are
	corn, banana, girl, boy but in the main list once it's added it reads
	boy, girl, banana, corn

	.pop removes an element from a specified position but we don't specify a position. Can you explain this?
