probably because I am trying to use strings and numbers in my function? And what the heck is a tuple?

Also what are other ways to do this? I could only come up with that many and he says there are 10.


# exercise 20 study drills #5
I see that += modifies the 'object-in-place' instead of building a new one. So does this mean I can use that in place of the current_line + 1 areas?


# exercise 21
need help with the 'puzzle' and figuring out how it's doing what it's doing. 
 so basically, can we look over study drills # 1 -3 for this exercise?
