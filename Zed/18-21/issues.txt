"Directly given:

    whiskey(whis, size)
TypeError: 'tuple' object is not callable"

probably because I am trying to use strings and numbers in my function? And what the heck is a tuple?

###################
The issue is  this line:
whiskey = "Knob Creek", 50

That overwrites your function whiskey, which is interesting.  Other programming languages do allow you to name variables and functions the same thing and then the programming language figures it out.

Also what are other ways to do this? I could only come up with that many and he says there are 10.

###################
From my understanding of this study drill, he just wants you to realize that there are multiple ways to engage with functions and get the data inside and how/when you give values to the variable names.  I think that you are fine.

# exercise 20 study drills #5
I see that += modifies the 'object-in-place' instead of building a new one. So does this mean I can use that in place of the current_line + 1 areas?

###################
You can use it in place.  It's a useful code to update a counter, like if you are counting sequences separately for your counter in your for-loop.

# exercise 21
need help with the 'puzzle' and figuring out how it's doing what it's doing. 
 so basically, can we look over study drills # 1 -3 for this exercise?

###################
We can look over them.  Before we talk, read up on prefix, postfix, and infix notation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation (also called postfix)
