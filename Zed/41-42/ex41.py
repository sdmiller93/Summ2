# class = tells python to make a new type of thing
# object = any instance of some thing
# instance = what you get when you tell python to create a class
# def = how you define a function inside a class
# self = inside the functions in a class, self is a variable for the instance/object being accessed
# inheritance = one class can inherit traits from another class
# composition = a class can be composed of other classes as parts
# attribute = a property classes have that are from composition and are usually variables
# is-a = a phrase to say that something inherits from another
# has-a = a phrase to say that something is composed of other things or has a trait
