# exercise 39
	Can I list several things under one reference? For instance, New York, has NY. For cities, could I then list like Ithica, Buffalo, Syracuse?
	
	Can you explain the code on lines 47-50. 
		More specifically; we say for argument? state and argument abbrev in the list of states dictionary? we want to print state and then abbrev in a string. 
			1. is abbrev coming from the items() portion of that code?
			2. How does it know the order of what I want things. Perhaps I wanted the abbrev first in the string before the states. How would I get that?

	An answer for study drills # 3?


# exercise 40
	Can you run my ex40studydrills.py script and help me find the error?

That's a tough error.
it is __init__ not _init_
You need two _ not one _ 
See __ not _
But it is not clear that there are two there.
