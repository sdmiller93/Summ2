# the error he shows "NameError: name 'car_pool_capacity' is not defined" is because a) he missed assigning that variable to anything, b) had a typo and defined a

# 1. 4.0 assigns the use of floating point so that the resulting numbers also have the decimal point. Without this ".0" it would not be floating point. 

# 3. I wrote comments for what I thought was necessary in the variable assignments. 

# 4. = is called ?? but I do know that it is what assigns values to variables.

# 6. my script to do math with variables
